ðŸ‘‹ **Hey, Iâ€™m Giovanna Pietra Nicolodi**

ðŸŽ“ I started studying STEM with a technical course in Maintenance in Microcomputers and Informatics at SENAI, which I graduated in 2018.
    I graduated as a Computer Technician at Instituto Federal Catarinense, in 2022.
    Currently, I'm studying Computer Engineering at Federal University of Santa Catarina.

ðŸ’» I've been working with QA for over 2 years now, in the experiences I've had, I've been able to actively work with both the requirements and modeling part, 
   as well as the elaboration, execution and documentation parts of the tests, both manual and automation.
